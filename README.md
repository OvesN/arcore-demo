## Augmented Reality Facial Styling App
This repository contains the source code for my Bachelor thesis at the Czech Technical University.

This is an Android application that uses ARCore and maintained Sceneform for rendering. The application allows users to try on different makeup and accessories using the front camera. A part of the application is a 2D editor where users can draw an image that will be mapped to their face as a mask. Users can save combinations of accessories, makeup, and face masks as 'Looks' and share them with other users. Users can also apply and modify created looks.

The google-services.json file is a dummy file. If you want to try the application, please contact me so I can share the correct file with API keys. [veronika.oves@gmail.com]
